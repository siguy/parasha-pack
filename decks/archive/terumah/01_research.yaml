  # Core emotional focus
  emotional_core: |
    GIVING from the heart. The joy and pride of contributing something
    special to build something beautiful together. "I helped make this!"

  connection_hook: |
    Every child has something special they can give. When we share what
    we have - our things, our talents, our help - we feel proud and happy.
    The Jewish people built something amazing because EVERYONE brought
    something. Even kids can help build something important!

  # Parasha type assessment
  parasha_type: "building"
  narrative_potential: "low"

  # For low-narrative parshiyot
  if_low_narrative:
    core_concept: |
      Building the Mishkan (God's special house) through voluntary gifts.
      The word "Terumah" means to lift up - when we give, we lift ourselves up too.

    tangible_hook: |
      Turn the abstract building instructions into a story of community
      contribution. Focus on WHAT people brought (beautiful, colorful things)
      and HOW it felt to give, not the technical construction details.

    scenario_ideas:
      - "If we were building something special for our classroom, what would YOU bring?"
      - "What's something you're really good at that you could share?"
      - "How do you feel when you help make something?"

  # Discussion seeds for Connection cards
  discussion_seeds:
    - "Have you ever given something special to help with a project? How did it feel?"
    - "What's something YOU are good at that you could share to help others?"
    - "When everyone helps, what can we build together that one person couldn't build alone?"
    - "How do you feel when someone asks for YOUR help with something important?"

  # Hebrew vocabulary recommendation
  hebrew_word:
    word: "תרומה"
    word_nikud: "תְּרוּמָה"
    meaning: "Gift / Contribution / Offering"
    why_this_word: |
      It's the name of the parasha and captures the core theme.
      Root means "to lift up" - when we give, we lift ourselves and others.
    torah_source: "Exodus 25:2 - 'Take for Me a terumah (gift)'"
    alternative_words:
      - word: "לֵב"
        word_nikud: "לֵב"
        meaning: "Heart"
        why: "The gifts were from 'everyone whose heart moved them'"

  # Safety notes
  avoid:
    - "Detailed construction measurements (boring for kids)"
    - "The cherubim on the ark (could be confusing - winged creatures)"
    - "The altar and sacrifices (too complex, appears at end of reading)"
    - "Any attempt to visualize God"
