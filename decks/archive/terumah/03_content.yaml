      what would YOU bring to help? Maybe crayons? A special pillow?

      The Jewish people worked TOGETHER - yachad! Have you ever
      built something with other people? Maybe you built a tall
      tower with blocks with a friend. Or helped your family
      cook dinner. Or made an art project with your class.
      Tell us about it! What did you make? Who helped?
      And here's a question: why is it more fun to build with
      friends? Let's share our ideas!

    teacher_script: |
      Our special Hebrew word today is TERUMAH! Can you say it?
      Te-ru-MAH! It means a gift - but not just any gift.
      A terumah is a gift you give because you WANT to, from your heart.
      The Torah says the people brought gifts "from everyone whose
      heart moved them." That means they felt the giving feeling
      inside! When you share something because you want to help,
      that's a terumah. Can you think of a terumah you gave?
      Let's say it again: Terumah!
