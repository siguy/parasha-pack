  # Not traditional narrative - focus on the giving/building theme

  # Learning objectives
  learning_objectives:
    understand: |
      The Jewish people built a special house for God by everyone
      giving something. When we all help, we can build amazing things.

      Pride in contributing. Joy in giving. Connection to community.
      "I can help too! What I have matters!"

    do: |
      - Identify something special they could contribute
      - Practice the word "Terumah" (gift)
      - Act out giving/contributing with enthusiasm

  # Card type adjustments for this parasha
  card_type_adjustments:
    spotlight: "skip"
    # Rationale: Moses is returning (kids know him), and the real
    # "characters" are the community. No strong new individual to introduce.
    # Use the slot for an extra Connection card instead.

    story_cards: "contribution moments"
    # Not traditional plot beats - show different gifts being brought
    # and the community working together

    connection_emphasis: "elevated"
    # Personal connection (#1 priority) is perfect for this theme
    # "What would YOU bring?" is the natural question

    power_word: "include"
    # Terumah is a great word - captures the whole parasha

  # Card assignments
  card_assignments:
    anchor:
      card_id: "anchor_1"
      emotional_hook: |
        This week is about GIVING! When you give something special
        to help build something, it makes you feel SO proud!
      symbol: |
        A heart with a gift coming out of it, or hands offering
        colorful treasures (gold, purple fabric, blue yarn) upward.
        Warm golden light. Community silhouettes in background.
      rationale: |
        Sets up the emotional theme immediately. Kids understand
        giving gifts. The heart-connection is key.

    # NO SPOTLIGHT - using slot for extra Connection card

    story_1:
      card_id: "story_1"
      moment: "God asks for gifts from the heart"
      title: "A Special Request"
      title_he: "בַּקָּשָׁה מְיֻחֶדֶת"
      energy_level: "medium"
      hebrew_keyword: "לֵב"
      hebrew_keyword_meaning: "Heart"
      roleplay: |
        Put your hand on your heart. When we give from our HEART,
        it means we REALLY want to give!
      rationale: |
        Opens the "story" - God asks, Moses listens. Introduces
        the concept of giving from the heart (nediv lev).
        Low-movement roleplay to start.

    story_2:
      card_id: "story_2"
      moment: "People bring gold, silver, and beautiful colored fabrics"
      title: "Beautiful Gifts"
      title_he: "מַתָּנוֹת יָפוֹת"
      energy_level: "high"
      hebrew_keyword: "זָהָב"
      hebrew_keyword_meaning: "Gold"
      roleplay: |
        Pretend you're carrying something SO special and beautiful!
        Walk carefully and put it gently in the pile!
      rationale: |
        The most visual moment - colorful fabrics, shiny gold/silver.
        Gets kids moving. Concrete items they can imagine.
        Peak visual richness.

    story_3:
      card_id: "story_3"
      moment: "Everyone works together to build"
      title: "Building Together"
      title_he: "בּוֹנִים בְּיַחַד"
      energy_level: "high"
      hebrew_keyword: "יַחַד"
      hebrew_keyword_meaning: "Together"
      roleplay: |
        Let's build together! Pretend to hammer, sew, carry, paint!
        Show me how YOU would help build!
      rationale: |
        Peak energy - physical movement, teamwork.
        Kids can do any building action they imagine.
        Emphasizes community effort.

    story_4:
      card_id: "story_4"
      moment: "The beautiful Mishkan stands complete"
      title: "Look What We Made!"
      title_he: "הִנֵּה מָה עָשִׂינוּ!"
      energy_level: "calm"
      optional: true
      hebrew_keyword: "מִשְׁכָּן"
      hebrew_keyword_meaning: "Tabernacle (God's special house)"
      roleplay: |
        Stand back and look up like you're seeing something AMAZING!
        Say "Wow!" together!
      rationale: |
        Payoff moment - seeing the result of everyone's contribution.
        Brings energy back down. Wonder and pride.
        Optional because parasha doesn't actually complete construction.

    connection_1:
      card_id: "connection_1"
      theme: "What Can I Give?"
      theme_he: "מָה אֲנִי יָכוֹל לָתֵת?"
      personal_question: |
        If we were building something special for our classroom,
        what would YOU bring to help?
      additional_questions:
        - type: "empathy"
          question: "How do you think the people felt when they brought their gifts?"
        - type: "action"
          question: "What's something special you have that you could share?"
      placement_rationale: |
        After the giving/building sequence, kids are primed to
        think about their own contributions. Core learning moment.

        - "proud"
        - "happy"
        - "excited"
        - "generous"

    connection_2:
      card_id: "connection_2"

        - type: "empathy"
          question: "Why is it more fun to build with friends than alone?"
        - type: "action"
          question: "What can you do to help at home or at school?"
      placement_rationale: |
        Extends the theme to teamwork. Good for longer sessions
        or if class is engaged in discussion.
      feeling_faces:
        - "happy"
        - "proud"
        - "helpful"
        - "connected"

    power_word:
      card_id: "power_word_1"
      word: "תרומה"
      word_nikud: "תְּרוּמָה"
      meaning: "Gift / Contribution"
      optional: true
      when_to_use: |
        Use as extension if focusing on Hebrew vocabulary.
        Can be woven into Anchor introduction instead.
      rationale: |
        Perfect word - it's the parasha name AND captures the theme.
        Root means "to lift up" - giving lifts us and others.

  # Teacher notes
  teacher_notes: |
    KEY THEME: Everyone has something to give. Giving feels good.

    APPROACH: This parasha has no traditional "story" - it's building
    instructions. We've reframed it as a community contribution story.
    Focus on the JOY of giving, not the technical details.

    VISUALS: This parasha is very colorful! Gold, silver, blue (תכלת),
    purple (ארגמן), crimson (תולעת שני). Lean into the beautiful materials.

    MOVEMENT: Story 2 and 3 have good roleplay opportunities.
    Let kids move - carrying gifts, building motions.

    DISCUSSION TIP: For Connection 1, you might bring a "contribution box"
    and ask kids what they'd put in it. Makes it concrete.

    OPTIONAL EXTENSION: If doing 2 sessions, Session 1 could be
    Anchor → Story 1-2 → Connection 1, Session 2 could review + Story 3-4 + Power Word.

    NOTE: We skipped Spotlight because Moses is a returning character
    and the parasha is really about the COMMUNITY, not an individual hero.

# Card count: 8 total (5 required + 3 optional)
