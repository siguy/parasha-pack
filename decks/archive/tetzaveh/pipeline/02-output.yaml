      optional: true
      rationale: |

  teacher_notes: |
    This deck focuses on the relatable excitement of special clothes rather than complex ritual details. Aaron is being introduced as a new character - he's Moses's brother who gets chosen for this important job. Kids will connect strongly to the dress-up theme and the feeling of being chosen for something special. The craftspeople story moment celebrates skill and beauty, which kids appreciate. If extending, the daily lighting of the menorah adds a responsibility element kids understand.
