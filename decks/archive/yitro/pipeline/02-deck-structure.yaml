  # Approach

  # Learning objectives
  learning_objectives:
    understand: |
      The Jewish people went to a special mountain and heard the most important
      words ever. When we listen carefully, we learn important things.
      Also: asking for help is smart, not weak!
    feel: |
      AWE at the spectacle of Sinai. Joy at family reunion. Appreciation for
      people who give us good advice. The special feeling of listening carefully.
    do: |
      Practice the "listening" pose (hand to ear). Say "Shema!" Practice giving
      a BIG hug. Shake like the mountain. Show amazed faces.

  # Card count decision
  card_count: 12
  card_count_rationale: |
    This is a narrative-rich parasha with two distinct story arcs (family/advice
    and revelation). Using full 12 cards to do justice to both threads:
    - 1 Anchor, 2 Spotlights (Moses and Yitro both important)
    - 5 Action cards (reunion, advice, arrival, thunder, listening)
    - 2 Thinker cards (one per theme)
    - 2 Power Words (שמע and עצה - both central)

  # Card assignments
  card_assignments:
    anchor:
      emotional_hook: |
        "This week is about feeling AWE - that's when something is SO amazing
        it makes you go WOW!"
      symbol: |
        Two stone tablets glowing with golden light, with Hebrew letters א-ה and ו-י
        (first 10 letters of alphabet, NOT God's name). Light rays from above.
      rationale: |
        The tablets are iconic and immediately recognizable. Sets up the culmination
        of the parasha. Kids will see these tablets and know "something special!"

    spotlight_1:
      character: "Moses"
      is_new_character: no
      emotion_focus: "devoted"
      why_kids_relate: |
        Moses works SO hard helping everyone. Kids know being tired! They also
        know it feels good when someone notices you're working hard.
      rationale: |
        Moses is the central figure. This week shows him as devoted but learning
        that asking for help is okay. Important lesson for perfectionist kids!

    spotlight_2:
      character: "Yitro"
      is_new_character: yes
      emotion_focus: "wise"
      why_kids_relate: |
        Like a loving grandfather who traveled far to visit and gives good advice.
        Kids love grandparent figures and understand "wise" grown-ups.
      rationale: |
        Yitro is new and his name is the parasha! His role as advice-giver is
        a key lesson. Establishing him warmly sets up the advice scene.

    action_1:
      moment: "Yitro arrives and reunites with Moses"
      title: "The Joyful Reunion"
      energy_level: high
      hebrew_keyword: "שִׂמְחָה (Joy)"
      roleplay: |
        "Hug like you missed someone SO much!"
      rationale: |
        Start with joy and love - universally relatable. High energy to engage
        kids immediately. Hugging is physical and fun.

    action_2:
      moment: "Yitro gives Moses advice about getting helpers"
      title: "Wise Advice"
      energy_level: medium
      hebrew_keyword: "עֵצָה (Advice)"
      roleplay: |
        "Point your finger like you're giving wise advice!"
      rationale: |
        Key lesson card. Calms energy after reunion excitement. Sets up Thinker
        discussion about helping each other.

    action_3:
      moment: "The people arrive at Mount Sinai"
      title: "The Big Mountain"
      energy_level: medium-high
      hebrew_keyword: "הַר (Mountain)"
      roleplay: |
        "Walk like you're climbing up, up, UP!"
      rationale: |
        Transition card - builds anticipation for the revelation. Physical
        movement (climbing) re-engages bodies.

    action_4:
      moment: "Thunder, lightning, shofar on the mountain"
      title: "Thunder and Light!"
      energy_level: high
      hebrew_keyword: "קוֹל (Voice/Sound)"
      roleplay: |
        "Shake like the mountain! SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!"
      rationale: |
        The spectacular climax! Kids LOVE drama. Shaking is fun and releases
        energy. Must keep it AWE-inspiring, not scary.
      optional: true

    action_5:
      moment: "The people listen to the Ten Commandments"
      title: "Listening Carefully"
      energy_level: calm
      hebrew_keyword: "שָׁמַע (Listen)"
      roleplay: |
        "Put your hand to your ear and listen VERY carefully!"
      rationale: |
        Calm after the storm. Teaches the important skill of listening.
        Connects to Shema. Prepares for reflection.
      optional: true

    thinker_1:
      theme: "Getting Help"
      personal_question: |
        "Has anyone ever helped YOU when something was too hard?"
      placement_rationale: |
        After Action 2 (advice scene). Kids just saw the lesson in action,
        now connect it to their own lives.
      feeling_faces: ["happy", "tired", "grateful", "proud"]

    thinker_2:
      theme: "At the Mountain"
      personal_question: |
        "Have you ever heard something SO loud it surprised you?"
      optional: true
      placement_rationale: |
        After Action 4-5. Reflects on the awe experience and connects
        to kids' own experiences of spectacle.
      feeling_faces: ["amazed", "excited", "nervous", "proud"]

    power_word_1:
      word: "עֵצָה (Advice)"
      when_to_use: |
        After Thinker 1 discussion, or as standalone extension.
        Can also be woven into Action 2 teacher script.
      optional: true
      rationale: |
        Practical word kids can use. Reinforces the lesson about asking for help.

    power_word_2:
      word: "שָׁמַע (Listen)"
      when_to_use: |
        After Action 5, or as standalone extension. Connects to Shema prayer
        which many kids know.
      optional: true
      rationale: |
        Central to parasha (Yitro "heard", people "listened"). Connects to
        broader Jewish practice.

  # Teacher guidance
  teacher_notes: |
    This parasha has two threads: the family/advice story (Actions 1-2) and the
    revelation story (Actions 3-5). You can do just the first thread if short on
    time - it's complete with Thinker 1.

    The thunder scene (Action 4) is the energy peak - have kids really shake!
    Then bring them back down with the quiet listening pose.

    Yitro is new - take a moment with Spotlight 2 to really introduce him warmly.
    Kids love the "wise grandfather" archetype.
