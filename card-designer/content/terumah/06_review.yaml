  # ISSUES SUMMARY
  # ============================================
  issues:
    critical: []
    # No critical issues found!

    recommended:
      - card_id: "all"
        issue: "Card back design does not exist yet"
        assigned_to: "Visual Director"
        recommendation: |
          Create card back design before print production.
          Can proceed with image generation for fronts first.

    minor:
      - card_id: "story_3"
        issue: "Hebrew keyword 'יַחַד' doesn't appear in this exact parasha"
        assigned_to: "Hebrew Expert"
        recommendation: |
          Already noted in Hebrew output. The word captures the
          communal spirit even if not literally in text.
          Consider keeping or substituting with a word from the parasha
          (e.g., וְעָשׂוּ - "they shall make").
          Minor - current choice is pedagogically sound.

      - card_id: "power_word_1"
        issue: "Optional card - may not be used in short sessions"
        assigned_to: "n/a"
        recommendation: |
          Consider integrating the word more into Anchor card
          so it's always taught. Currently marked optional.

  reviewer_notes: |
    STRONG DECK. The contribution theme works well for this building parasha.

    Highlights:
    - Smart decision to skip Spotlight (community is the hero)
    - Colorful materials make great visuals
    - Roleplay prompts are engaging and doable
    - Good energy arc from calm to active to reflective

    Watch for:
    - Card back needs design before printing
    - Verify Hebrew nikud with user before generation

    Ready for wife + teacher review!
